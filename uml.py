    """Function to instantiate one of the UML data container types.

    returnType: string (or None) indicating which kind of UML data type you want
    returned. If None is given, UML will attempt to detect the type most
    appropriate for the data. Currently accepted are the strings "List",
    "Matrix", and "Sparse" -- which are case sensitive.

    data: the source of the data to be loaded into the returned object. The
    source may be any number of in-python objects (lists, numpy arrays, numpy
    matrices, scipy sparse objects) as long as they specify a 2d matrix of
    data. Alternatively, the data may be read from a file, specified either
    as a string path, or a currently open file-like object.

    pointNames: specifices the source for point names in the returned object.
    By default, a value of 'automatic' indicates that this function should
    attempt to detect the presence of pointNames in the data which will
    only be attempted when loading from a file. In no names are found, or
    data isn't being loaded from a file, then we use default names. A value
    of True indicates that point names are embedded in the data within the
    first column. A value of False indicates that names are not embedded
    and that default names should be used. Finally, they may be specified
    explictly by some list-like or dict-like object, so long as all points
    in the data are assigned a name and the names for each point are unique.

    featureNames: specifices the source for feature names in the returned
    object. By default, a value of 'automatic' indicates that this function
    should attempt to detect the presence of featureNames in the data which
    will only be attempted when loading from a file. In no names are found,
    or data isn't being loaded from a file, then we use default names. A
    value of True indicates that feature names are embedded in the data
    within the first column. A value of False indicates that names are not
    embedded and that default names should be used. Finally, they may be
    specified explictly by some list-like or dict-like object, so long as
    all points in the data are assigned a name and the names for each point
    are unique.

    fileType: allows the user to explictly specify the format expected when
    loading from a file. Normally, if a file is being loaded, the extension
    of the file name is used to indicate the format. However, if fileType is
    specified, it will override the file extension. Also, when loading from a
    file with no extension, the user is requred to specify a format via
    fileType. This argument is ignored if loading from a python object.
    Currently accepted values are "csv" and "mtx", with a default value of None

    name: When not None, this value is set as the name attribute of the
    returned object

    keepPoints: Allows the user to select which points will be kept
    in the returned object, those not selected will be discarded. By
    default, the value 'all' indicates that all possible points in the raw
    data will be kept. Alternatively, the user may provide a list containing
    either names or indices (or a mix) of those points they want to be
    kept from the raw data. The order of this list will determine the order
    of points in the resultant object. In the case of reading data from a
    file, the selection will be done at read time, thus limiting the amount
    of data read into memory.

    keepFeatures: Allows the user to select which features will be kept
    in the returned object, those not selected will be discarded. By
    default, the value 'all' indicates that all possible features in the raw
    data will be kept. Alternatively, the user may provide a list containing
    either names or indices (or a mix) of those features they want to be
    kept from the raw data. The order of this list will determine the order
    of features in the resultant object. In the case of reading data from a
    file, the selection will be done at read time, thus limiting the amount
    of data read into memory. Names and indices are defined with respect to the data
    regardless of filtering by the ignoreNonNumericalFeatures flag; just
    because a feature is removed, the indices of subsequent features will not
    be shifted. The ignoreNonNumericalFeatures flag is only consdered after
    selection: if a selected feature has non-numerical values and
    ignoreNonNumericalFeatures is True valued, then that feature will NOT be
    included in the output. Similarly, if a feature has only numerical values
    in points that were selected, then even if there are non-numerical values
    in the points that were not selected, then that feature will be included

    ignoreNonNumericalFeatures: True or False (default False) value indicating
    whether, when loading from a file, features containing non numercal data
    shouldn't be loaded into the final object. For example, you may be loading
    a file which has a column of strings; setting this flag to true will allow
    you to load that file into a Matrix object (which may contain floats only).
    Currently only has an effect on csv files, as the matrix market format
    does not support non numerical values. Also, if there is point or feature
    selection occurring, then only those values within selected points and
    features are considered when determining whether to apply this operation.

    useLog: True, False, or None (default) valued flag indicating whether this
    call should be logged by the UML logger. If None, the configurable	global
    default is used.

    of all of the non-withheld data. The performance results for each of those
    tests are then averaged together to act as the return value. In the False
    case, we train on the training data, and then use the same data as the
    withheld testing data. By default, this flag is set to False.

    numFolds: the (int) number of folds used in the cross validation. Can't
    exceed the number of points in X, Y. Default is 10.

    arguments: dict containing the parameters to be passed to the learner, in the
    form of a mapping between (string) parameter names, and values. Will be merged
    with the contents of **kwarguments before being passed on. The syntax for prescribing
    different arguments for algorithm: arguments of the form {arg1=(1,2,3), arg2=(4,5,6)}
    correspond to permutations/argument states with one element from arg1 and one element
    from arg2, such that an example generated permutation/argument state would be "arg1=2, arg2=4"

    output: Can be used to force a format on the data object resulting from applying
    the learner to whatever is considered the testing data. This object is not seen
    by the user, but will be used by the input performanceFunction, and if the user
    has prior knowledge of requirements of that function, then they can enforced
    by UML instead of manually. By default, this parameter is set to None, indicating
    to match the formatting of the training data objects.

    multiClassStrategy: may only be 'default' 'OneVsAll' or 'OneVsOne'

    useLog - local control for whether to send results/timing to the logger.
    If None (default), use the value as specified in the "logger"
    "enabledByDefault" configuration option. If True, send to the logger
    regardless of the global option. If False, do NOT send to the logger,
    regardless of the global option.

    kwarguments: optional arguments to be passed to the specified learner. Will be merged
    with the arguments parameter before being passed on to the learner.
    The syntax for prescribing different arguments for algorithm:
    **kwarguments of the form arg1=(1,2,3), arg2=(4,5,6)
    correspond to permutations/argument states with one element from arg1 and one element
    from arg2, such that an example generated permutation/argument state would be "arg1=2, arg2=4"
